# calculatorapp
Building a full functional simple calculator with swift and storyboard.

- Create an ios app with storyboard ui

- creating a UI component
  - creating a label ui for showing results.
  - creating buttons (4 in a row), making it a stack view,
  - we can create a stack view inside view too as in last stack where 0 covers 2 positions width.
  - constrations to be used on main stack for up-down-left-right.
  - we can use constrations for each stack too, spacing can be given through menu.
  - for label shoeing result, we made it view and changed bg color same as label and gave constraints for right margin.
  - give a tag for all the numbers so it will be easy to use 1 function only.

- in editor menu, goto assistant to drag and drop items in viewcontroller.
 - ctrl + drag and give a unique name. 
 - viewcontroller tab to view all.
 - make sure to delete any additional chaining with the same button/ it creates problems and crashes.

- Functionalities:
 - creating a enum type for all,
 - adding the functions.
